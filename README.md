About Me

I am a university graduate in Journalism with extensive skills in writing, editing, fact-checking, and content evaluation. I specialize in analyzing news, articles, summaries, and digital content to ensure accuracy, clarity, and neutrality.

My professional approach emphasizes:

* Delivering content that is logically structured and error-free
* Maintaining high editorial standards in all work
* Following detailed instructions precisely for both editorial and AI-related tasks

I have experience working under tight deadlines, producing high-quality results, and adapting to various content formats, making me a strong fit for platforms like Mercor AI that require meticulous content evaluation and review.

Professional Skills

* Advanced content review and editing

Sample Work / Demonstrations
1. Article Summary

Original Article:

> Kenya’s economy has been fluctuating over the last year. The government reports growth, but citizens are struggling with the rising cost of living, including food, transport, and housing. Analysts suggest this is due to global inflation and local policy challenges.

Professional Summary:

> Kenya’s economy shows mixed results. While official reports indicate growth, citizens face rising living costs, which are influenced by global inflation and local policy challenges. This summary maintains factual clarity while condensing the key points.
2. Fact-Checking Example

Claim:

> “The government has doubled salaries for all public school teachers this year.”

Evaluation:

> This claim is unverified. Official reports indicate only partial salary adjustments for certain grades, not a full doubling. Proper verification and evidence-based conclusions are essential to maintain credibility and accuracy.

3. Writing & Editing Example

Original Text:

> The president said that the education is better now than before. But people think differently because the schools are not doing good.

Edited Version:

> The president stated that the education system has improved. However, many citizens disagree, citing ongoing challenges in school performance.

* Improve grammar and sentence structure
* Maintain neutral and professional tone
* Convey information clearly and accurately
